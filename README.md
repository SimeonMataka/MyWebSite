# MyWebSite

This website serves as my professional portfolio, showcasing my skills, experience, and projects as a Tech Enthusiast. Built using modern web technologies, it includes an about section, resume, and contact information. The site is fully responsive, offering a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Itâ€™s hosted on Render and regularly updated with my latest work, demonstrating proficiency in front-end and back-end development, as well as continuous deployment workflows.
